Questions for Cathy
- what are whrtype, size and dens and do we want to use them? they seem to be only present in the CA data, also hwtype is the same but only for the NV data.
- No DEM data 
- Where is the spatial soils data? Without that I can't figure out why the 12 streams are missing
- The final soil clip (from SSURGO) doesn't have a value SoilOrderD for some of the polygons. What to do?
